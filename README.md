# neuralnetwork
Anything to do with my own personal neural network practice.

Featuring nn.py which is my own neural network built from scratch using only Python list.
It features key components such as the structure of Layers, the use of weights and biases,
and a backpropogation function.

Testing and validation functions are also present. Data will need to be presented in arrays.
